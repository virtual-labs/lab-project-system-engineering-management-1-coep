    "introduction": "Welcome to the Project and System Engineering and Management - I developed at COEPTECH. This lab deals with the administrative and design part of the project. In the administrative part, the suitable organisational structure required for a typical type of project execution will be dealt with. The design part comprises energy and material balance, P & I diagram, workflows, and aligned design strategies <br>The execution part mainly comprises floating the inquiries, preparing the comparative statements, identifying the right vendors and finally completing the project successfully. While commissioning a plant, a well-defined strategy needs to be developed for the factory acceptance test, the Site acceptance test, and the Commissioning acceptance test. The entire experience that will be gained through this laboratory is worth pitching the student to any consulting firm for their professional life. The working models of the pilot plant are derived from the actual running plants, which ensures the correct version of simulating a plant.",
